**Version 1.0 • 2026 Edition**

You can build a fully functional app in a weekend. But one legal mistake — a missing privacy policy, an infringing name, undisclosed data collection — can get your app pulled from the App Store, hit with a fine, or both. This guide covers what actually matters, in plain language.

### 1. Terms of Service (ToS)
Your Terms of Service is your legal shield. It sets the rules for how users can interact with your app and limits your liability if something goes wrong. Without it, you have no documented agreement with your users.

**What to include:**
- **Permitted use.** Describe what users are allowed to do — and what they are not allowed to do.
- **Liability disclaimer.** Add a clause limiting your liability if your app causes loss, errors, or outages.
- **Dispute resolution.** Specify whether disputes go to arbitration or court, and in which state/country.
- **Account termination.** State that you can suspend or terminate accounts that violate the rules.
- **Right to modify.** Note that you can update the ToS at any time, and continued use means acceptance.
- **User-generated content clause.** If users can post content, add rules around what is allowed and who owns it.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** Without a ToS, users have no agreed-upon rules. You cannot legally ban abusive accounts, limit liability for outages, or protect yourself from basic lawsuits.

**Free tools:**
- Termly.io — generates a solid ToS in minutes
- GetTerms.io — lightweight and beginner-friendly
- Iubenda — works well for international compliance too

### 2. Privacy Policy
If your app collects any user data — names, emails, device info, IP addresses, analytics — you are legally required to have a privacy policy. This is not optional. Apple, Google, GDPR, and CCPA all mandate it.

**What to include:**
- **Data inventory.** List every type of data you collect — email, name, phone, device ID, location, behaviour, etc.
- **Purpose of collection.** Explain clearly what you do with the data — personalisation, analytics, billing, etc.
- **Third-party disclosure.** Disclose every third-party service that receives user data: Stripe, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.
- **Retention period.** State how long you keep data and when you delete it.
- **User rights.** Tell users how they can request access to, edit, or delete their data.
- **Placement.** Link the policy from your app's settings screen, signup page, and website footer.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** Apple and Google will reject your app if there's no privacy policy. GDPR fines can reach EUR 20M or 4% of global revenue. Even small apps have faced class-action suits for undisclosed tracking.

**Free tools:**
- Termly.io — free generator, covers GDPR + CCPA
- PrivacyPolicies.com — simple and widely used

### 3. IP & Trademark Checks
That clever app name you came up with may already be trademarked. Before you build a brand around it — domain, logo, App Store listing, social handles — verify it's yours to use.

**What to check:**
- **Trademark databases.** Search your country's trademark database before finalising any name.
- **Google & App Store search.** Search your app name + 'app' on Google. Check the App Store and Play Store for conflicts.
- **Social and domain availability.** Check that your domain, Twitter/X handle, and Instagram handle are all available.
- **Assets and fonts.** Any icon, illustration, or font you use must be licensed for commercial use — verify before shipping.
- **AI-generated code licensing.** If using AI-generated code, ensure no GPL-licensed snippets are embedded in your output.
- **Confusing similarity rule.** Avoid names that sound 'confusingly similar' to established brands — this is a legal standard.
- **Register your own trademark.** Once you gain traction, consider filing a trademark. In the US, it costs roughly $250–350.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** Companies send cease-and-desist letters fast. You could be forced to rebrand after building an audience — losing your SEO, social handles, and user trust overnight.

**Tools:**
- USPTO TESS — US trademark search (tmsearch.uspto.gov)
- IP India Portal — India trademark search (ipindia.gov.in)
- Namecheckr.com — check all social handles at once

### 4. Data Declaration & App Store Compliance
Apple and Google require you to declare every single data point your app collects — before you publish. This includes data collected silently by third-party SDKs, not just your own code.

**What to do:**
- **Apple Privacy Nutrition Label.** Complete Apple's 'App Privacy' section in App Store Connect before submitting.
- **Google Data Safety form.** Fill out Google Play's 'Data Safety' form completely and accurately.
- **Third-party SDK audit.** Audit every SDK you use — analytics tools, crash reporters, ad networks — for what they collect.
- **Location data.** If your app ever requests location access — even coarse/city-level — you must declare it.
- **Camera and photo access.** If your app requests camera or photo access at any point, that must be declared.
- **Consistency check.** Keep your app store declarations consistent with your privacy policy — discrepancies get flagged.
- **EU consent banner.** If you have EU users, implement a consent management platform for cookie/tracking consent.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** Apps are rejected for incomplete data declarations. Apple has pulled live apps retroactively. Google flags discrepancies between your safety form and actual app behaviour.

**Tools:**
- Exodus Privacy — audits what your SDKs are collecting
- Cookiebot / Osano — consent management platforms for EU compliance

### 5. User Data Security
Collecting data is one thing. Protecting it is a legal and ethical obligation. A breach — even a small one — can expose you to GDPR liability and destroy user trust.

**What to implement:**
- **Encryption.** Encrypt all data at rest (in your database) and in transit (use HTTPS everywhere).
- **Password hashing.** Never store passwords in plain text. Use bcrypt, argon2, or a managed auth provider like Clerk or Supabase.
- **Access control.** Implement role-based access control — not everyone on your team needs access to all user data.
- **Breach notification plan.** If you experience a breach, GDPR requires notifying users within 72 hours. Have a plan.
- **Access audit.** Regularly audit who has access to your production database and revoke stale access.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** A single exposed database — whether via a misconfigured S3 bucket or a weak password — can trigger GDPR investigations, media coverage, and user churn simultaneously.

### 6. Payment Compliance
If you charge users, you enter a layer of financial regulation most indie builders ignore. Get this wrong and your Stripe account can be frozen, your app suspended, or your users' payment data exposed.

**What to do:**
- **Use a compliant processor.** Use an established payment processor — Stripe, Razorpay, Paddle — never roll your own.
- **App store billing rules.** For in-app purchases on iOS and Android, you must use Apple/Google's payment system or face removal.
- **VAT compliance (EU).** If operating in the EU and your revenue qualifies, you must register for VAT.
- **Subscription transparency.** Be transparent about subscriptions: show renewal dates, how to cancel, and billing terms upfront.
- **Refund policy.** Include a refund policy in your ToS and make it easy to find.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** Apple and Google have removed apps for bypassing in-app payment rules. Stripe can freeze accounts for undisclosed business models. Hidden subscription terms attract chargebacks and regulator attention.

### 7. Children's Privacy — COPPA
If there's any reasonable chance your app is used by children under 13 (and in the EU, under 16 in some cases), special laws apply. This is one of the most heavily enforced areas of app regulation.

**What to do:**
- **Age gate.** If your app could attract under-13 users, add age-gating at signup.
- **Parental consent.** You cannot collect personal data from children without verifiable parental consent.
- **No tracking of minors.** No behavioural advertising or user profiling is allowed for children's apps.
- **EU threshold.** In the EU, GDPR sets the age threshold at 16 in most countries (varies by member state).

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** The FTC has fined companies millions for COPPA violations. TikTok was fined $5.7M in 2019. 'I didn't think kids would use it' is not a legal defence.

### 8. Email Marketing Compliance
Sending emails to users without the right permissions is illegal under CAN-SPAM (US), GDPR (EU), and CASL (Canada). This applies to newsletters, onboarding sequences, and product updates.

**What to do:**
- **Explicit opt-in.** Only email users who explicitly opted in — pre-checked checkboxes do not count under GDPR.
- **Unsubscribe mechanism.** Every marketing email must include a clear, working unsubscribe link.
- **Record consent.** Store opt-in records — date, source, and what the user consented to.
- **Sender identity.** Include your business name and mailing address in every email footer.
- **Transactional vs. marketing.** Transactional emails (receipts, password resets) are exempt from most opt-in rules.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** Sending unsolicited emails violates CAN-SPAM and GDPR. GDPR fines are significant. More practically: getting marked as spam destroys your sender reputation permanently.

### 9. AI-Generated Content Disclosure
If your app generates or surfaces AI-created content — text, images, recommendations — disclosure is increasingly required by law and platform guidelines. This area is evolving fast.

**What to do:**
- **Label AI output.** Label AI-generated content clearly, especially in high-stakes contexts like health, finance, or legal.
- **EU AI Act compliance.** The EU AI Act (effective 2025–2026) requires disclosure for AI systems interacting with users.
- **Human oversight.** If using AI for automated decision-making that affects users, you may need to allow human review.
- **No false representation.** Do not imply AI output is human-written or human-reviewed when it is not.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** The EU AI Act classifies certain AI systems as 'high risk' with strict requirements. Even in the US, the FTC has flagged misleading AI practices as deceptive advertising.

### 10. Accessibility (ADA / WCAG)
Web and mobile apps are increasingly held to accessibility standards. In the US, the ADA has been applied to digital products. In the EU, the European Accessibility Act takes effect in 2025.

**What to do:**
- **Alt text.** Add alt text to all images so screen readers can describe them.
- **Keyboard navigation.** Ensure your app is fully navigable by keyboard — no mouse-only interactions.
- **Colour contrast.** Use sufficient colour contrast — WCAG AA standard requires a ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text.
- **ARIA labels.** Use proper ARIA labels for interactive elements that don't have visible text labels.
- **Automated testing.** Run your app through an automated checker like Axe or Lighthouse as a starting point.

> ⚠ **If you skip this:** US courts have ruled web apps must comply with ADA. Companies like Domino's and Netflix have faced successful accessibility lawsuits. The EU's 2025 deadline adds further urgency.
